## 3.1. Configure TheHive

### Configure Cassandra

nano /etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml

- Change cluster_name: (change to any name)
- change listen_address: (THeHive IP address) 170.64.141.171
- change rpc_address: (THeHive IP address) 170.64.141.171
- change seeds (under seed_provider): (THeHive IP address) 170.64.141.171:7000
- stop cassandra service: systemctl stop cassandra.service
- remove all related files: rm -rf /var/lib/cassandra/*
- start the service: systemctl start cassandra.service
- check service status: systemctl status cassandra.service
    - → It should be active (running) by now

### Configure ElasticSearch → use to query data

nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml

- Un-comment and Change cluster_name: TheHive
- un-comment node.name
- Un-comment & change network.host: (THeHive IP address) 170.64.141.171
- Un-comment cluster.initial_master_nodes & remove node-2
- start the service: systemctl start elasticsearch
- enable the service: systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
- check service status: systemctl status elasticsearch.service
    - → It should be active (running) by now

### Configure TheHive

check if TheHive can have access to some certain files: 

- ls -la /opt/thp → this is the file path that theHive requires access to → currently root has access to theHive directory

- chown -R thehive:thehive /opt/thp → change owner to theHive user and theHive group over to the destination directory

Configure theHive configuration file: nano /etc/thehive/application.conf

- change hostname to IP address 170.64.141.171
- change cluster_name: Brian
- change application.baseUrl to 170.64.141.171

→ By default: TheHive has 

-Cortex: is their data enrichment and response capability

-Mist: used for CTI platform (Cyber Threat Intelligence)

- start the service: systemctl start thehive
- enable the service: systemctl enable thehive
- check service status: systemctl status thehive
    - → It should be active (running) by now

### Login to TheHive: http://170.64.141.171:9000

- Credentials:
admin@thehive.local
secret
- If credential fails to get access, check elasticsearch service → create jvm file
Create a jvm.options file under /etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options.d and put the following configurations in that file.
    - nano /etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options.d/jvm.options *
    nano /etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options.d/jvm.options *
    -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true
    -Xms2g
    -Xmx2g
